# C_Sharp-Jokes-App
A jokes app that allows you to input jokes and their answers, so that you can have all your best jokes in one place. This application is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, and Update) application, so I created all the forms, the website, and the database.

## Personally this app is a fun way for me to learn C# and is one of the first of many projects I will create with the language.
